//! # Amari Flynn - Probabilistic Contracts and Verification
//!
//! Named after Kevin Flynn from Tron: Legacy, who discovered that spontaneous,
//! imperfect emergence (the ISOs) represented a form of perfection beyond rigid
//! determinism. This library embodies that philosophy: formal verification should
//! prove what's impossible while allowing rare, emergent possibilities.
//!
//! ## Philosophy: Three Types of Events
//!
//! Flynn teaches us to distinguish between three categories of events:
//!
//! 1. **Impossible** (P=0): Formally proven to never occur
//!    - Violates mathematical axioms
//!    - Proved unreachable via formal verification
//!    - System invariants guarantee exclusion
//!
//! 2. **Rare** (0 < P << 1): Bounded probability, tracked and verified
//!    - Low but non-zero probability
//!    - Statistical bounds verified via Monte Carlo
//!    - Tracked as legitimate possibilities
//!
//! 3. **Emergent** (P > 0): Possible but not prescribed, enabling discovery
//!    - Not predicted or designed
//!    - Arise spontaneously from system rules
//!    - The "ISOs" of your system
//!
//! ## Core Concept
//!
//! Traditional verification asks: "Can this happen?"
//! Flynn asks: "Is this impossible, rare, or merely unpredicted?"
//!
//! This library provides tools to:
//! - Prove what cannot happen (P=0)
//! - Bound what rarely happens (P<<1)
//! - Enable what might emerge (P>0)
//!
//! ## Quick Start
//!
//! ```rust
//! use amari_flynn::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Create probabilistic values
//! let coin_flip = Prob::with_probability(0.5, true);
//! ```
//!
//! With the `std` feature (distributions and rare events):
//!
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature = "std")]
//! # {
//! use amari_flynn::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Sample from distributions
//! let die_roll = Uniform::new(1, 6).sample();
//!
//! // Track rare events
//! let miracle_shot = RareEvent::<()>::new(0.001, "critical_hit");
//! # }
//!
//! ## Future Integration with Amari
//!
//! A future `geometric` feature will integrate Flynn with Amari's geometric algebra
//! types, enabling probabilistic contracts over geometric computations.
//!
//! ## Roadmap
//!
//! - **SMT-LIB2 Backend**: solver-valid proof obligations in QF_NRA with
//!   certified rational enclosures. See [`backend::smt`] (std builds).
//! - **Creusot Support**: Rust-native formal verification (future)
//!
//! ## The ISO Philosophy
//!
//! Like the ISOs in Tron: Legacy, the most valuable behaviors in a system
//! are often those that emerge spontaneously, unpredicted by design. Flynn
//! enables you to prove safety boundaries while preserving space for emergence.
//!

//! ## Example: Game Mechanics Verification
//!
//! ```rust
//! use amari_flynn::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Verify critical hit rate is bounded
//! let crit_rate = 0.15;
//! let crit_prob = Prob::with_probability(crit_rate, ());
//!
//! // Statistical verification that P(crit) ≤ 0.20
//! // (leaving room for buffs/modifiers while maintaining balance)
//! ```
